This processor can only perform add, sub, and, or lw, and sw operations.
Because there are no jump instructions (J type) and the instruction memory block is not supported.
The processor only executes four R-type instructions. Therefore, the ALU control is only symbolic (i.e., there is no combination between ALU control and the funct field to determine the R-type instruction).
Pls read 1->2->report for understanding.
